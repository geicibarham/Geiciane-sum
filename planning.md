# Sum and Have Fun!

<ul> 

<li>Planning started on cleaning up the app and deleting unecessary files.</li>

<li>Second I reset my CSS to reduce browser inconsistencies (border, margin, font of size headings and etc).</li>

<li>After that, utilizing my teacher knowledge on second grader students (their developmental stages and what they are able to do at this age). Next comes the knowledge on UX that I aquired trough courses, practice and what I do daily at work while building Investor Relations Websites.</li>

<li>I know The app will need to be fun, colorful, and utilizing icons and images to make it atractive to students. </li>

<li>The next part will be the component tree and how to pass data between components. I will utilize a landing page that will have buttons for: entering the game or entering the score page that I will possibly build in the future. React Router will be utilized for switching between components. </li>


<li> On the next step, I went ahead I checked the documentation for the Math Api, it seems fairly simple and fun to use. After reading their documentation, I realized that the parameters for URL (the one we will utilize for the API call) will be...</li>


<li>I will create a component called "form", which will hold: both random numbers for adding the numbers, and the field for the student to put their answer. </li>


<li>We need to create a state for both of the random numbers, the student's answer and their score (this will be implemented only if I have time). Utilizing the Usestate Hook, we will generate two random numbers that will make an API call to API Math. I like utilizing axios to make requests because it is shorter than fetch and produces more readable code.</li>
