<p>The "next button" will generate different random numbers and if you have submitted your answer, it will restart the colors on the page back to purple and set the entered answer to an empty string.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Clone the repo, then run "npm i" to instal all the dependencies. To start the server enter "npm start" on the command line amd the page will automatically open on localhost300 in your default browser.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>

<p>There is different ways of posting this app to production, run the command "npm run build", then Webpack will generate minified files. You can then utilize GH pages or netfly to deploy the app. I have used netlify. 
First run "npm run build" to generate the production version of the files, then push your code to a github repo, create an account on netlify (if you don't have one) then connect your repo to netlify and it will build the production app and publish it.</p>
